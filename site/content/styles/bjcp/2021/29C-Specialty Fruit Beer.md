## Overall Impression
A appealing combination of fruit, sugar, and beer, but still recognizable as a beer. The fruit and sugar character should both be evident but in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.

## Appearance
Same as Fruit Beer.

## Aroma
Same as Fruit Beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add an aroma component. Whatever additional aroma component is present should be in balance with the fruit and the beer components, and be a pleasant combination.

## Flavor
Same as Fruit Beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add a flavor component. Whatever additional flavor component is present should be in balance with the fruit and the beer components, and be a pleasant combination. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some added sugars will have unfermentable elements that may provide a fuller and sweeter finish; fully fermentable sugars may thin out the finish.

## Mouthfeel
Same as Fruit Beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.

## Comments
If the additional fermentables or processes do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it as one of the other (non-Specialty) Fruit Beer styles and omit a description of the extra ingredients or processes.
