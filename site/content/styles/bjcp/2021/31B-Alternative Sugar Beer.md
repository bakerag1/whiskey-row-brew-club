## Overall Impression
A tasteful integration of sugar and beer, but still recognizable as beer. The sugar character should both be evident and in balance with the beer, not so forward as to suggest an artificial product.

## Appearance
Same as the base beer, although some sugars will bring additional, usually darker, colors.

## Aroma
Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add an aroma, which should be a pleasant, balanced combination with the beer.

## Flavor
Same as the base beer, except that some additional fermentables (e.g., honey, molasses) may add a flavor, which should be a pleasant, balanced combination with the beer. Added sugars should not have a raw, unfermented flavor. Some unfermentable sugars provide a fuller finish, while fully fermentable sugars can thin out the finish.

## Mouthfeel
Same as the base beer, although depending on the type of sugar added, could increase or decrease the body.

## Comments
The additional sugar should be apparent somewhere in the sensory profile. If the sugars do not add a distinguishable character to the beer, enter it in the base style category. A honey-based beer should not have so much honey that it is perceived more like a mead with beer (i.e., a braggot) than a honey beer. This style should not be used for styles where the alternative sugar is fundamental to the style definition, or where a small amount of neutral-flavored sugar is used simply to increase gravity, increase attenuation, or lighten flavor or body; those beers should be entered as the normal base style.
