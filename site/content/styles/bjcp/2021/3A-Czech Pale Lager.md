## Overall Impression
A lighter-bodied, rich, refreshing, hoppy, bitter pale Czech lager having the familiar flavors of the stronger Czech Premium Pale Lager (Pilsner-type) beer but in a lower alcohol, lighter-bodied, and slightly less intense format.

## Appearance
Light yellow to deep gold color. Brilliant to very clear, with a long-lasting, creamy white head.

## Aroma
Light to moderate bready-rich malt combined with light to moderate spicy or herbal hop bouquet; the balance between the malt and hops may vary. Faint hint of caramel is acceptable. Light (but never intrusive) diacetyl and light, fruity esters are optional. No sulfur.

## Flavor
Medium-low to medium bready-rich malt flavor with a rounded, hoppy finish. Low to medium-high spicy or herbal hop flavor. Bitterness is prominent but never harsh. Flavorful and refreshing. Low diacetyl or fruity esters are optional, but should never be overbearing.

## Mouthfeel
Medium-light to medium body. Moderate carbonation.

## Style Comparison
A lighter-bodied, lower-intensity, refreshing, everyday version of Czech Premium Pale Lager.

## Ingredients
Soft water with low sulfate and carbonate content.Traditional Czech hops. Czech Pilsner malt. Czech lager yeast. Low ion water provides a distinctively soft, rounded hop profile despite high hopping rates.

## History
Josef Groll initially brewed two types of pale beer in 1842–3, a výčepníand a ležák, with the smaller beer having twice the production; Evan Rail speculates that these were probably 10 °P and 12 °P beers, but that the výčepní could have been weaker.This is the most consumed type of beer in the Czech Republic at present.

## Comments
The Czech name of the style is světlé výčepní pivo.
