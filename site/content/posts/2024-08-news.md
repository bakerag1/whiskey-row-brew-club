Another Horseshoes & Homebrews is in the books. We didn't have any horseshoes, but we made up for
it in homebrews, with 9 entries in the gauntlet and 5 others on tap. Take a look at this post for
more details and pictures: [2024 Horseshoes and Homebrews](https://whiskeyrowbrewclub.com/posts/2024-07-horseshoesandhomebrews/)


John had a water report done for downtown Prescott, so if you live near there, you might find it useful
for dialing in your water profile for brewing. Members can access it through this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FD_SI5gHyqpX4w4zet5Hs_JMwoU9jeOR/view?usp=sharing)
It's simple to punch these numbers into Bru'n Water, Beersmith, or Brewfather to get suggested
additions for a target water profile.


We have a full slate of events still coming up, so keep your eyes on the calendar (link at the top)
