Another awesome Horseshoes & Homebrews weekend in the books! 8 taps of delicious homebrew flowing throughout, 4 taps of Brown Bag beer, and some very cinnamony apple pie distilled "water". 

We had 9 entries from 7 brewers in the Session (under 5%) gauntlet:
  * First place went to Susan and her Cherry Limeade Session Mead (yes only 4% ABV), which was promptly emptied by all in attendance.  
  * Second went to Wes with his spot-on and highly-crushable, traditional Gose.
  * Third was a solid return to homebrewing from John with a crispy Brut IPA

The real buzz was about how good the full lineup was, everybody took home much less beer than they came with. Great job brewers!!!

We had 4 entries in the salsa competition and Jodi took the win!

Taco bar was great and carried over to breakfast, with some fresh scrambled eggs, to give us the energy to pack up and drive home.

We didn't get around to the horseshoes, but keg jam, corn hole, polish horseshoes (look it up), and ladder toss were well represented.
