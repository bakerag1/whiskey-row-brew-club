[Square Site](https://whiskey-row-brew-club.square.site/shop/holiday-party/WY6ADWYOH5ES37BIRZZ57E7M).
See you there!

What a great year the club had this year! We started with a St. Patrick's day hangout at Founding Fathers.
Then we brought in the busy summer season with a sloshball event, where no one was seriously injured. We
attended and served homebrew at two festivals, using our awesome new jockey box. Two of us made it to the 
final round of the National Homebrew competition. Four of us went to the Great American Beer Festival. We
had 48 gauntlet entries this year. We started a lengthy journey into sensory training that will continue
through 2025. We held two very cold and windy brew days at Wren House. Horseshoes & Homebrews was a hoot,
even without any horseshoes being thrown. We downed countless pints of Wes-Side Pale Ale at Lazy G. We
cleaned our mile of highway 3 or 4 times. We got our German lager and sauerkraut fix at our second 
Oktoberfest. 

Thanks to everyone in the club for making it a great year. Next year is looking to be just a little bit
better, with plans to adjust the calendar slightly to the chase the good weather.
