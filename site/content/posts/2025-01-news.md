I hope everyone had fun at the holiday party, I know I did! The first was on Wednesday, so we're
coming into 2025 hot, with our first meeting on the 16th. It feels like we haven't been to Cocky's
in ages. We're going to start our events a little earlier this year with a sloshball day near
the end of March, if the weather cooperates. We're in the starting phases of hosting our own homebrew
competition. We'll keep it small and limit it to AZ homebrewers and British styles. If all goes well,
we can consider expanding for next year. We'll judge it in August and will need a lot of help from
members to pull it off. Bring you name ideas for the competition to the next meeting, please.

We're having a highway cleanup January 18, if you haven't been before, we clean a mile of Outer Loop
Road, then usually go to Wren House. If 4 or more people show up, you basically will be walking a mile
and picking up a very manageable amount of trash along the way. We have the bags and safety vests, gloves
are recommended.
