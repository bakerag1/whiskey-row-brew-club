As mentioned in the last meeting, we'll be launching a study group aimed at getting some folks into the BJCP. I created a survey to hopefully get some of the logistics figured out without too much discussion. If you are interested in becoming a judge, please fill out this survey, it's way shorter than the exam.<div><a href="https://forms.gle/TxssPrf7DPoNk7GaA">Study Group Survey </a><br></div>
