This month is a busy one! 

We have a highway cleanup on 3/15, meet us at 11am at the Old Stage Stop. 

St. Patrick's Day is on 3/17, join the 
[pub crawl](https://prescott-now.com/2024-st-patricks-day-pub-crawl/), or post up along the route,
it's a good bet some club members will be coming through. 

Our second annual sloshball event is returning a little early this year, March
29 (weather permitting). Watch your email for full details. If you aren't familiar, it's
kickball with beer! Spectators welcome for this members-only event. 

Ghosts of the West, a new homebrew competition hosted by our club, is starting to take shape. The
website is up, with information about dates, more to come! [Ghosts of the West](/ghosts-of-the-west).
We're going to need a lot of help with stewards, judges, and more!

There's still time to enter in the first AZ comp of the year [ASH Cactus Classic](https://beerawardsplatform.com/2025-ash-cactus-classic). They also always
need help judging, it's a great way to practice your chops, and see what other brewers can do.
 

The annual Lazy G competition is fast approaching, there's still a little time to brew time to
brew! Check the newly updated competition page for deatils - [Lazy G Competition](/lazy-g-club-only-competition).
This month's gauntlet is the same styles, so be sure to come check out the competition.
