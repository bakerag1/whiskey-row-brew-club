Spring is about to be sprung after some crazy days!

We have some fun stuff coming up. Next week, we have two off-flavor and judging sessions,
these member-only sessions are a good opportunity to enhance your tasting and judging skills.

The annual Lazy G competition is fast approaching, there's still a little time to
brew! Check the competition page for deatils - [Lazy G Competition](/lazy-g-club-only-competition).

Big Brew is an annual event for homebrew clubs around the country to get together and make some
beer. Our event is at the Wren House Prairie Patio the day after the official day. It's always fun
and a great time for prospective members to get to know the club in a very
casual setting. [Learn more and RSVP](/events/2025-05-brewday)

Our famous camping trip [Horseshoes & Homebrews](/events/2025-07-horseshoesAndHomebrews) is scheduled for July 24-27, it's a hoot, you don't
want to miss it... we might even play horseshoes this year!

Ghosts of the West, a new homebrew competition hosted by our club, is starting to take shape. The
website is up, with information about dates,and amazing art from Mike! [Ghosts of the West](/ghosts-of-the-west).
We're going to need a lot of help with stewards, judges, and more!
