Since the campout is a week later this year, we'll meet at [Fairweather Social Club](https://www.fairweathersocialclub.com/) to hang out, in place of our general meeting. Wear some club merch, in case any prospective members show up. 

We have a [highway cleanup](../events/2025-07-highway-cleanup.md) on 7/19 11am at Old Stage Stop, it's more fun than it sounds, and we
usually head over to Wren House after for some refreshment.

Our famous camping trip [Horseshoes & Homebrews](/events/2025-07-horseshoesAndHomebrews) is approaching fast July 24-27,
it's a hoot, you don't want to miss it... Tuk is determined to actually play horseshoes this year! If camping isn't your thing, 
feel free to come up Saturday morning, it's always a good time. Please fill out the [RSVP](https://forms.gle/mDMGsMoaVvrJKYqY8),
even if you aren't going.


[Ghosts of the West](/ghosts-of-the-west), is kicking off right after the camp out,
we're going to need a lot of help with stewards, judges, and more! [Volunteer sign up](https://beerawardsplatform.com/ghosts-of-the-west)
is open now. We added the historic style London Brown, and secured a mail in location and a Flagstaff drop-off
spot. Please go ahead and sign up to volunteer, it will help with my nerves!
