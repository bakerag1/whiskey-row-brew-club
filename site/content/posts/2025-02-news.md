Happy Valentines Day! 

The annual Lazy G competition is fast approaching, there's still plenty of time to
brew! Check the newly updated competition page for deatils - [Lazy G Competition](/lazy-g-club-only-competition).
This month's gauntlet is the same styles, so be sure to come check out the competition.

Next month is a busy one! 

We have another highway cleanup on 3/15. St. Patrick's Day is on 3/17, join the 
[pub crawl](https://prescott-now.com/2024-st-patricks-day-pub-crawl/), or post up along the route. 

Our second annual sloshball event is returning a little early this year, March
29 (weather permitting). Watch your email for full details. If you aren't familiar, it's
kickball with beer! Spectators welcome for this members-only event.

We're hosting our first open competition in many years this August, we settled on the name Ghosts of the West,
and will be focused on AZ homebrewers and British styles. It should be a lot of fun and everyone that wants
to be involved should be able to. Watch for the details to trickle out over the coming months.
