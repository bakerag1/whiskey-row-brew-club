Almost forgot to send a newsletter! I'll make it short.

The gauntlet schedule for 2025 is out! Take a look [BOTY Scedule](/brewer-of-the-year/schedule),
we have some interesting competitions lined up.

The October general meeting is the deadline for nominations for the Board of Directors. Have a friend
(you must both be members) send an email to whiskeyrowbrewclub@gmail.com to nominate you for the position
of your choice if you wish to run. Elections will be at the November meeting and you must have already been
nominated in order to run. No absentee ballots, so plan on making it in November!

Whiskey Row Brew Club killed it at the annual Meadfest competition in Flagstaff, getting 4 medals and an
honorable mention for BOS! I think we were the second most medalling club aside from the host club.

We're also just 2 days away from the NHC final round where we also have 4 medals in contention. Watch the
awards with a short delay here https://www.youtube.com/live/NPTBcVn7PDA?si=9y0LX2fjSDfBRIln

November 3 we're having a Learn to Brew Day brewout at Wren House. These events are always fun and we'll have
several people brewing. This is a great opportunity for prospective members to get a feel for the club, or for
new brewers to get some hands-on experience, please RSVP using this form [Learn to Brew Day RSVP](https://forms.gle/apg4L1Ry4BzMzFLY8)
