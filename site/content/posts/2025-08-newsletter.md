If you're reading this, I guess you haven't melted yet, so that's a good start!

Horseshoes & Homebrews was a blast as usual! We swapped the usual throwing games for board and party games this year. We had 4 taps flowing the whole time, and only one 911 call was made! (oops)

[Ghosts of the West](/ghosts-of-the-west) has had 15 beers registered so far, which is good enough to hold the competition, but means we don't need much help. There's still a few days left to enter if you have any british style beers on hand. 

At the end of the month is the always fun [Labor Daze](/events/2025-09-labor-daze) festival in Williams, the club will have a tent for selling merch again. It's a free entry festival with beer tickets for purchase. Hope to see you there!

There's a [Women's Brew Day](/events/2025-10-womens-brew-day) that just got added to the calendar in October. "Curious about brewing your own beer? Join us for a fun and relaxed Women‚Äôs Learn to Brew Day at Mike and Jodi‚Äôs ranch. Whether you're a complete beginner or have dabbled a little, this is a welcoming space to get hands-on with the brewing process, ask questions, and connect with other women who love craft beer (or are just brew-curious!). Men are invited to be seen and not heard unless asked. There will be a raffle to win a horse and goat. No experience or equipment necessary‚Äîjust bring your curiosity üßê

Keep an eye out for Oktoberfest in September and National Learn to Brew Day in October or November.
