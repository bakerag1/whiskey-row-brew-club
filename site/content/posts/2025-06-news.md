We had a successful highway cleanup a few weeks ago and a few of us went to the ClardALE beer festival after. The event was much improved from last year and we will make this a priority for next year. We also got together to paint the much anticipated [Mile High Beer Project](https://www.milehighbeer.com/) coming soon to Cortez St., it's looking great!

[Whiskey Row Brew Fest](https://prescottevents.ticketspice.com/2025-whiskey-row-brew-fest) is locked in June 14! The club will be judging best of show, selling merch and promoting the club again. We still have judging slots available, if you are available to attend and want to participate, please fill out this members-only [survey](https://forms.gle/3Ry6UZv8n1Zj6K6e9) today before 6!

Our famous camping trip [Horseshoes & Homebrews](/events/2025-07-horseshoesAndHomebrews) is scheduled for July 24-27, it's a hoot, you don't
want to miss it... Tuk is determined to actually play horseshoes this year! Since it's a week later this year, we'll meet at [Fairweather Social Club](https://www.fairweathersocialclub.com/) to hang out, in place of our general meeting. Wear some club merch, in case any prospective members show up.

[Ghosts of the West](/ghosts-of-the-west), is kicking off right after the camp out,
we're going to need a lot of help with stewards, judges, and more! [Volunteer sign up](https://beerawardsplatform.com/ghosts-of-the-west) is open now.
