*updated for 2025*  
 Each year, the club collaborates with local brewery Lazy G to put on a competition. Club members enter beers for a chance to have it brewed and served at Lazy G. Additionally, the beer will be entered in the Pro-Am competition at the Great American Beer Festival!

**Rules:**  
* Entries will be Judged as one of three styles: Brown Ale; KÃ¶lsch; or Mexican Lager.
* Open to active members of both the American Homebrewers Association and the Whiskey Row Brew Club (both, not one or the other).
* For each beer entered, submit two twelve-ounce crown cap bottles, with no labels or cap markings with [entry labels](../forms/bottle-labels.pdf) rubber-banded to the bottle. 
* Recipe sheets included for all entries, must include name and AHA member number.
* Entries due either at the April 17, 2025 general meeting or May 1, 2025 at the board meeting, or as arranged with John Allen.
* When designing your recipe be mindful that Lazy G has to sell 5-10 barrels of the beer.
