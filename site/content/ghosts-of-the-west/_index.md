From the haunted, old-west town of Prescott, Arizona, comes the Ghosts of the West homebrew competition.
The Whiskey Row Brew Club has discovered through extensive research that many of our
local ghosts are the descendants of award winning English homebrewers[^1]. What choice did
we have, but to create a competition to honor this heritage! 

For our first open competition in many years, we're setting some constraints to make sure we can be
successful. We're restricting it to British beer styles, AZ brewers only, and 150 entries.

Dates:
Registration Opens: 7/21/25 8am
entry deadline: 8/13/25
awards ceremony: On or after 8/24

**Details:**
* award categories will be determined based on number of entries
* Medals will be awarded for first, second, and third in each category
* First place in each category will be judged for Best of Show (provided sufficient bottles are available)
* Best of Show winner will receive a trophy, a $100 LazyG gift card, and more!

**Rules:**  
* Open only to current residents of Arizona
* For each beer entered, submit two twelve-ounce crown cap bottles, with no labels or cap markings with the entry label rubber-banded to each bottle. 
* Limit 5 entries per brewer
* Limit 1 entry per brewer per subcategory
