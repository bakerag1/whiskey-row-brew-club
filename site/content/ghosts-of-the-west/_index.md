The inaugural edition of the Ghosts of the West homebrew competition is coming in 2025!

For our first open competition in many years, we're setting some constraints to make sure we can be
successful. We're restricting it to British beer styles, AZ brewers only, and 150 entries.

Dates:
Registration Opens: 7/21/25 8am
entry deadline: 8/13/25
awards ceremony: On or after 8/24

**Rules:**  
* Open only to current residents of Arizona
* For each beer entered, submit two twelve-ounce crown cap bottles, with no labels or cap markings with the entry label rubber-banded to each bottle.
