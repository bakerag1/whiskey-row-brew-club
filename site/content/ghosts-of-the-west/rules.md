## Competition Rules

* This competition is AHA/BJCP sanctioned and open to any Arizona resident, amateur homebrewer
age 21 or older.
* All mailed entries must be received at the mailing location by the shipping deadline -
please allow for shipping time.
* All entries will be picked up from drop-off locations on the day of the drop-off deadline.
* All entries must be handcrafted products, containing ingredients available to the
general public, and made using private equipment by hobbyist brewers (i.e., no use
of commercial facilities or Brew on Premises operations, supplies, etc.). 
* The competition organizers are not responsible for mis-categorized entries, mailed
entries that are not received by the entry deadline, or entries that arrived damaged.
* The competition organizers reserve the right to combine styles for judging and to
restructure awards as needed depending upon the quantity and quality of entries.
* Quality judging of all entries is the primary goal of our event. Judges will evaluate
and score each entry. The average of the scores will rank each entry in its category.
Each flight will have at least one BJCP, Cicerone, or Pro-Brewer judge.
* Brewers are not limited to one entry in each category but may only enter each
subcategory once.
* The competition committee reserves the right to combine overall style categories
based on number of entries. All possible efforts will be made to combine similar
styles. All brews in combined categories will be judged according to the style they
were originally entered in.
* The Best of Show judging will be determined by a Best of Show panel based on a
second judging of the top winners. 

## Entry Acceptance Rules

Paid Entry Limit: 150

Participants are limited to 5 entries. Submit 2 bottles or cans per entry.

Each entry will consist of capped or corked bottles that are void of all identifying
information, including labels and embossing. Printed caps are allowed, but logos or
writing must be blacked out completely. If you have cans, they will be accepted as well if
they meet the above criteria for bottles.

12oz (375 ml) brown glass bottles are preferred; however, green, and clear glass will be
accepted. Swing top bottles will likewise be accepted as well as corked bottles. 12oz
and 16oz cans will be accepted.

All requisite paperwork must be submitted with each entry and can be printed directly
from this website. Entry paperwork should be attached to bottles using rubber bands.
Tip: enclose each entry in a plastic snack bag and attach to each bottle using rubber
band to protect against moisture/spillage that may make the entry label unreadable.
Be meticulous about noting any special ingredients that must be specified. Failure to
note such ingredients may impact the judges' scoring of your entry.
