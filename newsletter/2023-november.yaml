news: |
  Learn to brew day at Wren House was a great time, we had 3 all-grain
  batches brewed on-site without incident. We got the green light to
  have more of these events in the future, so watch for another in the Spring!

  The next general meeting will have board elections, you must be present to

  We're having a women's brew day 11/19! Some of the women in the club are getting
  together to brew a collaborative gauntlet entry for the holiday party. Should be
  a good time, let us know if you want to join and we'll get you the details.
  <br><br>
  Our famous holiday party is coming fast, we'll have a white elephant gift exchange,
  ugly sweater contest, pot-luck, homebrew on tap, and more! Of course, we'll
  have our amazing raffle with the usual smorgasbord of gift cards and beer
  themed whatzits, along with some potential surprises. For those who haven't
  attended, this might the best bang for your buck raffle on the planet!
  Details will be emailed to current members.

  We're excited to try a new general meeting location in January, Cocky's
  Chicken & Brew! They really know their way around the fryer and have a
  small but good tap selection, and unbelievable prices. Hush puppies, okra
  and black lager, oh my! More details to come as it approaches.
