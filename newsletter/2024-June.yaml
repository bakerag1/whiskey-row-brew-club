  The weather is heating up, and so are the beery events! I believe we had our
  first club sporting event. Sloshball was a blast and we had less than 5 injuries!
  We broke in the new Jockeybox with icy cold lager and seltzer, while The Flatearthers
  were obliterated by The Sloshballerz.

  Whiskey Row Brew Fest is tomorrow and it looks to be much bigger than last year. We're
  serving samples, selling merch, and spreading the word on the club and homebrewing this
  year, it should be a blast. We also expect to judge more than 26 beers!

  The June meeting has an exciting education topic, we're having a trivia contest with great
  prizes, including a full all-grain ingredient kit. So study the interwebs and be ready with
  your buzzer!

  The club campout is coming up and is always a hoot. We're having a taco bar on saturday
  to compliment our Session gauntlet and salsa competition, if you can't (or don't want to)
  camp, try to come out for the day Saturday (7/20), it's worth the drive.

  September 1 is the Williams Labor Daze festival. We had a pretty good showing from the club
  last year, even though we had very short notice. This year I think the club can win the people's
  choice award, so get brewing! Let the board know if you are interested in going, maybe we can
  organize some more camping or something around this.
