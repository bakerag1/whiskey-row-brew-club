  The board approved some by-law changes about the election and composition of the board:
  elections are in November, postions start in Januay (how we were doing it anyway)
  ; Nominations end in October, enables us to have normal ballots
  ; Ex-Presidents have permanent board status
  ; At-large limited to two.<br>
  Hopefully these changes will reduce some confusion in the coming year, questions/objections welcome at
  the March meeting.
