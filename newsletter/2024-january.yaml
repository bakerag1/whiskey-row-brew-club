  I hope everyone enjoyed the holiday party as much as I did! Members can look
  at some pictures of it on <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1FnFVIoR_UFxNhwjCpYXRTzou_OgUd_nX?usp=sharing">Google Drive</a>
  The raffle had people walking away with great bottles of mead and beer, pounds
  of hops and specialty grain, gift cards, and merch provided by the club
  and local businesses. A silent auction provided great deals on full sacks of
  grain, as well as some good fun. This brought in significant funds for the club
  so look forward to voting on some cool ways to spend the money this year.

  This past year was a blast! We saw some record gauntlet turnouts with 9 entries
  in October and 11 in December, with 9 different brewers earning points towards Brewer
  of the Year (Congratulations Wes!). We ran into 
  capacity problems at our meetings from all the new/renewed interest in the club. We 
  participated in 4 AZ beer festivals, judging best of show awards for two. We had a 
  bunch of folks go to HomebrewCon in San Diego and served our brew to homebrewers from 
  all over the world. We earned at least 6 medals in AZ competitions, and had one 
  second round entry in NHC. The campout was amazing as usual, and our new Oktoberfest
  party was wunderbar. Our VP is brewing at newly opened Brown Bag Burger + Brewery
  in Downtown Prescott, expecting to have house made beers on tap in early February.

  2024 is shaping up to be even better. We're excited to try a new general meeting 
  location this month, Cocky's Chicken & Brew! They really know their way around the fryer and have a
  small but good tap selection, as well as unbelievable prices. Order food
  at the counter and beer at the bar. We are targeting 3 festivals this year and we
  should be able to serve our own beer at all 3! The Lazy G comp will be all American
  Pale Ale, so it will be a really tight competition, get brewing. HomebrewCon is in Denver this year,
  combined with GABF, hopefully we can have a good turnout and win some hardware at NHC.
