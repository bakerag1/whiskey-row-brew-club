  The Lazy G competition is closing in, get your Pale Ale brewed! The entry deadline has been extended to 5/3,
  you will need to make arrangements with John A. if you are unable to turn yours in at the April General Meeting.
  The gauntlet is the same style, so there's a good chance we'll all get to sample the winning brews this year!
  <br><br>
  Our National Homebrew Day celebration will be May 5th at the Wren House Patio. We'll start brewing at 10am,
  the beer sales start at 1pm and we'll be making session mead too, members will have access to enough honey for
  a five gallon batch. We've done a few of these and they are always a blast.
  <br><br>

  We've finally nailed down the whole gauntlet calendar for 2024. June is any style wheat beer, must contain a
  minimum of 40% wheat in the grist, most are good summer beers, but they don't have to be. The holiday party 
  will be an anything goes best of show: ordinary bitter vs. pastry stout; flanders red vs american light 
  lager; bring your A game... and your B game!
