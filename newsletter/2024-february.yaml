news: |
  In case you missed it, the meeting at Cocky's was a blast, they are terrific hosts and we had an epic Mead 101 topic!

  As you probably already heard, our own Vice President, John Allen is the brewer at the newly opened Brown Bag Burgers + Brewery,
  what you may not know is that his beers are now on-tap! Stop by and grab a pint or three!

  In competition news, the Cactus Classic has opened registration for ASH members, and will open generally on 2/16. This competition
  is on the Master Homebrewer Circuit, so don't delay registering, these competitions have a tendency to sell out very fast. Since it's
  in Phoenix, we also have the opportunity to volunteer as judges and stewards at the competition. Also, registration for
  National Homebrew Con is coming up February 27, with 10 entries, this could be a game changer for the Brewer of the Year
  competition! Be sure to list your club as Whiskey Row Brew Club. Also, coming up very soon is our Lazy G Pro-Am competition.
  The winner will get to help brew their recipe at Lazy G, and have it entered in the Great American
  Beer Festival Pro-Am competition. They will also, probably get some sweet merch and we'll have a tapping
  party when they start serving it. A pre-requisite for both NHC and the Lazy G competition is that you are
  an active member of American Homebrewers Association, when you are signing up, use the code WRBC to get $5
  off, plus $5 will go to the club.
