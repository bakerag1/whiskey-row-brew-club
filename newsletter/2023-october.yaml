  Last month, we had a blast at Oktoberfest, we had tons
  of terrific homebrew, mead, and food. Helles Lager and 
  Bratwursts were flowing like the Rhine! Look for this to
  be an annual event.

  Coming up expect to see a brew day announced for national
  learn to brew day. It will likely be at Wren House again,
  which turned out really great last time. Schedule a brew
  day for 11/5 and be ready to haul your stuff! 
  Also, we'll be doing another highway cleanup soon, date to 
  be set at the next general meeting.

  The board recently updated the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-W5jDbM2_v9vdavDHXka__5XpVymvNh54QV00_gAtuU/edit?usp=drive_link">Brewer of the Year</a> rules for
  next year with two exciting changes. First, we agreed on a
  point structure for the National Homebrew Competition. It's
  a little later in the year next time, so there's plenty of 
  time to prep. Second, we've added a throwback to the origins
  of the club gauntlet called "Duels", where members can challenge
  one another to one on one competitions! You can start challenging
  people for January now! More details in the link above, ask your
  questions at the next meeting.

  Sadly, WRBC and Lazy G did not take home a medal for the GABF pro-am. 
  Next years competition will probably take place a little later, and be
  narrowed to either a single style, or a few styles.
