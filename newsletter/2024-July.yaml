  This summer is flying by. Whiskey Row Brew Fest was great fun, our biggest turnout for the competition
  in a long time. The breweries were excited to get their awards, even if they didn't hear it announced.
  We definitely know some improvements to make for next year, but I think we accomplished all we set out
  to do. Great job to everyone that helped!

  National Homebrew Competition first round results are in and WRBC has 4 entries going to the final round! 
  Susan has 3 meads, and Andrew has a Doppelbock. The NHC is the biggest homebrew competition in the world,
  so don't be surprised if you see them wearing their ribbons around!
  <br><br>
  The fabulous campout is in two weeks, get your tents, trailers, and kegs ready! Details for
  <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cd59DHpCtdjW3SHZ4Kym4tHeUgOIFgyj7EkFjCFxu78/edit?usp=sharing">Horseshoes & Homebrews</a>
  is for members only, if your membership lapsed you might want to re-up here <a href="/join-the-club">Join Now!</a>
  We're planning on bringing back the classics: kegjam; horseshoes; Grand Canyon Brewing Tour; session gauntlet; and salsa competition.
  We're also spicing it up a bit with a taco lunch! Most of the action is Saturday, if a day trip is more your
  jam. Hope to see you there!

  September 1 is the Williams Labor Daze festival. We had a pretty good showing from the club
  last year, even though we had very short notice. This year I think the club can win the people's
  choice award, so get brewing! We intend to plan a camping trip around it, so watch your email.
  <br><br>
  The Flagstaff club's mead & cider competition (<a href="https://meadfest.mountaintopmashers.net/">meadfest</a>) is on the calendar and registration is already open. 
  This is the smallest (non-gauntlet) brewer of the year eligible competition, so why not try your hand
  at a cider or mead, or 5! Be sure to account for lower maturation times when picking a recipe! Also coming up is
  the ASH Copper State Cup. We have some big beers on the gauntlet calendar, so you might want to plan ahead and brew
  soon.
